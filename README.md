## Summary of Findings

 Although bills for collection for payment mode seems to be more common than letters for credit, but after some further investigations that is true but letters for credit are mostly used for high cost of freight
From the exploration it was revealed that there is a strong positive relationship between cost of freight and fob val after using logarithmic scale for x and y axis, that is the higher the cost of freight the higher the fob value, however further analysis can be done to test the significance of the correlation.


## Key Insights for Presentation

freight values as well as cost of freight on payment mode across the banks
